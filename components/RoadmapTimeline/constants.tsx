          with precious items, wearables, or backgrounds will have a higher earn rate through NFTL multipliers.

          Welcome to the Niftyverse; a world filled with DEGENS and NFT communities alike with a shared vision to have
          fun and build a thriving gaming community. What makes the Niftyverse stand apart from other metaverses is our
          p2e games being the centerpiece. Walk into our arcade room filled with fun mini-games or venture to
          destinations on the map to jump into our classic titles like Nifty Smashers and Nifty Kart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world is centered around a city reminiscent of our popular Sushiswap level in Nifty Smashers. To kick
          things off we will hold a land sale with premium options in the city as well as cheaper undeveloped land
          outside the city limits. Acquiring premium land in the city where all the action is comes with the additional
          benefit of having buildings already in place that you can design however you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re a creative type, don&apos;t miss this opportunity - we will have an asset store for you to
          design assets such as buildings or trees and list them for sale based on your defined limits and pricing. Do
          you want a cool DEGEN theme park or Cyber Kongz meetup? Build out the Niftyverse to whatever your heart
          desires!

          Oh... and it&apos;s probably worth noting the land and assets will be sold with <strong>NFTL</strong> (a
          portion of which will be burned) so it might be worth hodling your p2e earnings.
