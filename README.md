This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set `WORDPRESS_API_URL` to be the URL to your GraphQL endpoint in WordPress. For example: `https://myapp.wpengine.com/graphql`.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
WORDPRESS_API_URL=...

# Only required if you want to enable preview mode
# WORDPRESS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=
# WORDPRESS_PREVIEW_SECRET=
```

### TypeScript

WordPress schema typings are generated using `@graphql-codegen`  
Anytime you want to regenerate the types (such as if you make changes to the GraphQL schema or install a WPGraphQL extension), you can run `yarn generate` again. This will overwrite your current `types/generated/graphql.ts` file.
